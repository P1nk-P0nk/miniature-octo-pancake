# miniature-octo-pancake
A project about making a little CLI music player to learn Go

## Roadmap

- [ ] Make a very simple music player depending on one command line argument (the file)
- [ ] Add a simple TUI
- [ ] Add library gestion (just a simple db repertoring files should be enough)
- [ ] Add MPRIS interface support
- Some more features if I feel to
